# Frequently Asked Questions (People Also Ask from Google)

## What are the six types of topology?
In a computer network, there are mainly six types of physical topology, they are:
•	Bus Topology.
•	Ring Topology.
•	Star Topology.
•	Mesh Topology.
•	Tree Topology.
•	Hybrid Topology.

## Is bus topology secure?
In a bus topology, any computer connected to a network can see all the data transmissions on all the other computers. So there are no chances of security. In a star topology, security depends on the central device.

## Why is bus topology best?
Advantages of Bus Topology :

It works very efficiently well when there is a small network. The length of cable required is less than a star topology, and it is easy to connect or remove devices in this network without affecting any other device. Very cost-effective as compared to other network topologies, i.e., mesh and star.

## What is the cheapest topology?
Bus topology
Bus topology is the easiest and cheapest type of topology to install. With a one-to-one ratio of devices to drop lines, this topology requires less cable than other topologies, reducing the installation time and expenses. Adding new devices to the network is also straightforward.


## Is hub works in full-duplex mode?
If more than one device can talk at once it is called Full Duplex. A hub is always Half Duplex, so only one device at a time can communicate. A switch can handle Full Duplex communication, so multiple computers can talk with each other simultaneously through a switch.

## What is hub and types of hub?
The three types are active, passive and intelligent. Active hubs amplify the incoming electric signal, whereas passive hubs do not amplify the electric signal. Intelligent hubs are kind of active hubs.

## What is a functuion of Layer 3 switch?
* support routing between VLANs
* separate ports into virtual LANs (VLANs) and perform the routing between them.

1. Wi-Fi Router (Home or Small Offices with internet connection)
2. Wireless Access Point (Medium/large organisations) => Multiple APs can be managed by a single router.
3. If you want to have multiple wi-fi routers connected with a main router, it will work, but manageability is going to be the headache as configuration need to be updated at every point. 
4. Wireless APs => only for wireless devices; no firewall; does not support DHCP service; does not have a WAN port; to further extend network's existing wireless signal
5. Wi-Fi Router => for both wired/ wireless devices; firewall exist; DHCP service supported; has a WAN (internet) port.
