* PCM is a method used for digitizing analog signals, such as voice or music, in which the analog signal is sampled and then converted into a series of numerical values.
*  These numerical values represent the amplitude of the signal at a particular time and are referred to as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) values.
*  In PCM, the maximum PAM value represents the maximum amplitude that can be represented in the digital signal. 
*  The normalized PAM value is a ratio of the actual PAM value to the maximum PAM value that can be represented in the digital signal. 
*  For example, if the maximum PAM value in a PCM system is 255 and the current PAM value is 128, the normalized PAM value would be 0.5. 
*  This value represents the amplitude of the signal relative to the maximum amplitude that can be represented in the digital signal. 
*  The normalized PAM value is important in PCM systems because it ensures that the digital signal is represented accurately and that the dynamic range of the analog signal is preserved. Additionally, it allows for consistent representation of signals across different PCM systems that may have different maximum PAM values.
